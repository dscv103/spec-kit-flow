# Check Task Status

@speckit-flow What is the current implementation status?

## Request

Please analyze the current state of the SpecKitFlow implementation:

1. **Read** `specs/speckit-flow/tasks.md` to see which tasks are complete `[x]` vs pending `[ ]`
2. **Identify** the next task(s) that can be started based on dependency order
3. **Report** a summary of:
   - Tasks completed
   - Current phase progress
   - Next recommended task with its dependencies
   - Any blockers or issues

Focus on Phase 1 tasks (T001-T024) first before Phase 2.
