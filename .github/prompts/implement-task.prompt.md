# Implement SpecKitFlow Task

@speckit-flow Please help me implement SpecKitFlow.

## Current Request

{{input}}

## Context

I'm working on implementing SpecKitFlow, a parallel DAG-based orchestration system. The implementation follows a structured task workflow defined in the specification documents.

## What I Need

1. **Identify the next task** from `specs/speckit-flow/tasks.md` that needs implementation
2. **Check dependencies** are complete before starting
3. **Implement** following all instruction files and code quality standards
4. **Verify** acceptance criteria are met
5. **Mark complete** in tasks.md when done

## Files to Reference

- `specs/speckit-flow/plan.md` - Architecture and schemas
- `specs/speckit-flow/tasks.md` - Task list with acceptance criteria  
- `specs/speckit-flow/traceability.md` - Requirements matrix

Start by reading the current state of tasks.md to identify what needs to be done next.
